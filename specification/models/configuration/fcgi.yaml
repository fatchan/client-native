        Defines a regular expression to extract the script-name and the path-info from the URI.
        Thus, <regex> must have two captures: the first to capture the script name, and the second to capture the path- info.
        If not defined, it does not perform matching on the URI, and does not fill the FastCGI parameters PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED.

setParam:
  description: |-
    Sets a FastCGI parameter to pass to this application.
    Its value, defined by <format> can take a formatted string, the same as the log directive.
    Optionally, you can follow it with an ACL-based condition, in which case the FastCGI application evaluates it only if the condition is true.

passHeader:
  description: |-
    Specifies the name of a request header to pass to the FastCGI application.
    Optionally, you can follow it with an ACL-based condition, in which case the FastCGI application evaluates it only if the condition is true.
    Most request headers are already available to the FastCGI application with the prefix "HTTP".
    Thus, you only need this directive to pass headers that are purposefully omitted.
    Currently, the headers "Authorization", "Proxy-Authorization", and hop-by-hop headers are omitted.
    Note that the headers "Content-type" and "Content-length" never pass to the FastCGI application because they are already converted into parameters.

logStderr:
